    "description": "PC-14 was originally deposited with the Riken BioResource Center as a cell line derived from human lung adenocarcinoma (undifferentiated type) in 1989. The RIKEN BioResource Center subsequently informed the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC) that short tandem repeat (STR) DNA profile analysis, undertaken in collaboration Immuno-Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd Japan, has shown this cell line to be identical to PC-9 a cell line derived from human lung adenocarcinoma (differentiated type). The misidentification occurred prior to the cell line being deposited at the RIKEN BioResource Center. The name of the cell line has been changed to PC-9 to reflect this finding",
