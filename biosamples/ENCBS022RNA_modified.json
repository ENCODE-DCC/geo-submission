    "description": "Primary Human Nasal Epithelial Cells (HNEpC) are isolated from normal human nasal mucosa and stain positive for cytokeratin.  The epithelium in the nasal cavity cleans, humidifies, and warms inhaled air. In addition, it produces mucus, which binds particles that are subsequently transported to the pharynx by cilia on the epithelial cells. HNEpC are useful for in vitro studies of these processes.",
